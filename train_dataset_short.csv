1824,"a ever-growing datasets inside observational astronomy have challenged scientists inside many aspects, including an efficient and interactive data exploration and visualization. many tools have been developed to confront this challenge. however, they usually focus on displaying a adatoms images or focus on visualizing patterns within catalogs inside the predefined way. inside this paper we introduce vizic, the python visualization library that builds a connection between images and catalogs through an interactive map of a sky region. vizic visualizes catalog data over the custom background canvas with the help of a shape, size and orientation of each object inside a catalog. a displayed objects inside a map are highly interactive and customizable comparing to those inside a images. these objects should be filtered by or colored by their properties, such as redshift and magnitude. they also should be sub-selected with the help of the lasso-like tool considering further analysis with the help of standard python functions from in the jupyter notebook. furthermore, vizic allows custom overlays to be appended dynamically on top of a sky map. we have initially implemented several overlays, namely, voronoi, delaunay, minimum spanning tree and healpix grid layers, which are helpful considering visualizing large-scale structure. all these overlays should be generated, added or removed interactively with one line of code. a catalog data was stored inside the non-relational database, and a interfaces were developed inside javascript and python to work within jupyter notebook, which allows to create custom widgets, user generated scripts to analyze and plot a data selected/displayed inside a interactive map. this unique design makes vizic the very powerful and flexible interactive analysis tool. vizic should be adopted inside variety of exercises, considering example, data inspection, clustering analysis, galaxy alignment studies, outlier identification or simply large-scale visualizations.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
3094,"we propose the framework considering optimal $t$-matchings excluding a prescribed $t$-factors inside bipartite graphs. a proposed framework was the generalization of a nonbipartite matching problem and includes several problems, such as a triangle-free $2$-matching, square-free $2$-matching, even factor, and arborescence problems. inside this paper, we demonstrate the unified understanding of these problems by commonly extending previous important results. we solve our problem under the reasonable assumption, which was sufficiently broad to include a specific problems listed above. we first present the min-max theorem and the combinatorial algorithm considering a unweighted version. we then provide the linear programming formulation with dual integrality and the primal-dual algorithm considering a weighted version. the key ingredient of a proposed algorithm was the technique to shrink forbidden structures, which corresponds to a techniques of shrinking odd cycles, triangles, squares, and directed cycles inside edmonds' blossom algorithm, the triangle-free $2$-matching algorithm, the square-free $2$-matching algorithm, and an arborescence algorithm, respectively.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
8463,"nanostructures with open shell transition metal or molecular constituents host often strong electronic correlations and are highly sensitive to atomistic material details. this tutorial review discusses method developments and applications of theoretical approaches considering a realistic description of a electronic and magnetic properties of nanostructures with correlated electrons. first, a implementation of the flexible interface between density functional theory and the variant of dynamical mean field theory (dmft) highly suitable considering a simulation of complex correlated structures was explained and illustrated. on a dmft side, this interface was largely based on recent developments of quantum monte carlo and exact diagonalization techniques allowing considering efficient descriptions of general four fermion coulomb interactions, reduced symmetries and spin-orbit coupling, which are explained here. with a examples of a cr (001) surfaces, magnetic adatoms, and molecular systems it was shown how a interplay of hubbard u and hund's j determines charge and spin fluctuations and how these interactions drive different sorts of correlation effects inside nanosystems. non-local interactions and correlations present the particular challenge considering a theory of low dimensional systems. we present our method developments addressing these two challenges, i.e., advancements of a dynamical vertex approximation and the combination of a constrained random phase approximation with continuum medium theories. we demonstrate how non-local interaction and correlation phenomena are controlled not only by dimensionality but also by coupling to a environment which was typically important considering determining a physics of nanosystems.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
