# PDFreader README file that explains all the folders/files in the repository (what can be found where).

PDFreader is a Portable Document Format (PDF) reader and summarizer that is built with Python.

PDFreader is developed by Claire W., Lesli G., Miracle A., and Rinnah M. Our goal is to create a smart PDF reader that will provide better paper reading experience and knowledge mining.

First, it parses the PDF file to extract essential information from the paper. 
Second, it is able to mine knowledge from the extracted information to help with paper comprehension and inspire new research ideas.
